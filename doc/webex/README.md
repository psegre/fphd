>
> **ERRATA CORRIGE**
>
> The **hold-time constraint** written at 01:29:18/02:56:02 is correct,
> the hold time has to be **lower** than the sum :
>
>   _hold time < clock-to-output propagation delay + combinational propagation delay_
>
> However the same formula rewritten at 01:32:50/02:56:02 is **WRONG**, as before
> the hold time has to be lower (and **not larger** as written in the slide) than the sum.
